## How to Extract & Run Teach Phases

### Option 1: Extract from Documents (Manual)

1. Open each subsystem planning document
   - `01_CORE_STATE_MACHINE.md` § 4.5
   - `02_HARDWARE_ABSTRACTION.md` § 5.5
   - `03_MCP_SERVER.md` § 4.5
   - `04_AGENT_BACKENDS.md` § 5

2. Copy the Python code from "Artifact:" sections

3. Save to `examples/` directory

### Option 2: Automated Extraction (Recommended)

```bash
# Create examples directory
mkdir -p examples

# Extract all code blocks (this would require a script)
# For now, manually copy from the markdown files
```

### Option 3: Use the Guide

Follow `subsystem_plans/TEACH_PHASES.md` which has:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Complete code listings
- Expected outputs
- Integration flow diagrams

## Running Your First Teach Phase

### 1. Create the script

Create `examples/teach_phase_1_types.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Teach Phase 1: Verify data types work."""
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Dict

@dataclass
class RobotStatus:
    state: str
    position: List[float]
    heading: float
    battery: float
    gripper_open: bool
    detected_objects: List[Dict]

# Demo: Create and print status
status = RobotStatus(
    state="IDLE",
    position=[0.0, 0.0],
    heading=0.0,
    battery=95.0,
    gripper_open=True,
    detected_objects=[]
)

print("✓ Teach Phase 1: Types work!")
print(f"  Status: {status.state}")
print(f"  Position: {status.position}")
print(f"  Battery: {status.battery}%")
assert status.state == "IDLE"
print("✓ All assertions pass")
```

### 2. Run it

```bash
$ python examples/teach_phase_1_types.py
✓ Teach Phase 1: Types work!
  Status: IDLE
  Position: [0.0, 0.0]
  Battery: 95.0%
✓ All assertions pass
```

### 3. Celebrate ✅

You've just validated the first phase!

## Why This Approach is Better

### Traditional Approach ❌
```
Hours 0-6: Write state machine (might have bugs)
Hours 6-10: Write hardware layer (integration issues)
Hours 10-14: Write MCP server (incompatible interfaces)
Hours 14-18: Write agent (nothing works together)
Hours 18-24: Debug integration nightmare 😱
```

### Teach Phases Approach ✅
```
Minutes 0-5: Verify types work (✓)
Minutes 5-10: Verify kinematics work (✓)
Minutes 10-20: Verify state machine works (✓)
Minutes 20-25: Verify full mission works (✓)
  → NOW write production code with confidence
Minutes 25-30: Verify hardware backend (✓)
  → Now integrate with state machine (no surprises!)
Minutes 30-35: Verify MCP server (✓)
  → Now integrate with everything (smooth!)
Minutes 35-40: Verify agents (✓)
  → Integration complete, full system working! 🎉

Total: 40 minutes validation vs 24 hours debugging
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. Extract teach phase scripts
2. Run all 13 in sequence
3. Verify all pass with ✓ checkmarks

### Short Term (Hours 2-6)
1. Extend teach phase code to production modules
2. Add error handling
3. Add logging
4. Add type hints

### Integration (Hours 6-18)
1. Combine state machine + hardware
2. Combine MCP + state machine
3. Combine agent + MCP
4. Full system working!

### Polish (Hours 18-40)
1. Edge cases
2. Performance tuning
3. Demo preparation

## Pro Tips

### 💡 Run Teach Phases in Isolation
Each script is independent and can be debugged separately without affecting others.

### 💡 Modify & Experiment
Change parameters in teach phases to understand behavior:
```python
# Change target from [1.0, 0.0] to [2.0, 2.0]
sm.set_goal("NAVIGATING", {"target_position": [2.0, 2.0]})
```

### 💡 Stack Teach Phases
Build complexity by combining simpler ones:
```python
# Teach phase 4 is really teach 1 + 2 + 3 combined
# So if teach 4 fails, debug teach 1, 2, 3 individually
```

### 💡 Use as Regression Tests
Keep teach phases and run them anytime you change code:
```bash
python examples/teach_*.py  # Run all at once
```

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to run all 13?**
A: Yes, they're incremental. Skip one and later phases might fail.

**Q: What if a teach phase fails?**
A: That phase validates that specific concept. Fix it before proceeding.

**Q: Can I run teach phases in parallel?**
A: No, they build on each other. Run sequentially.

**Q: Should I modify teach phase code?**
A: Try it! They're meant to be simple enough to understand and modify.

**Q: What about edge cases?**
A: Teach phases test happy path. Use main test suite for edge cases.

**Q: How do I scale teach phases?**
A: Convert them to production code by adding error handling and logging.
